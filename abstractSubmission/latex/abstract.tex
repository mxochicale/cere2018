objectives, methods, results, and conclusions (with a maximum of 300 words).


%% EXTRA IDEA: human movement is not noise
% Recently, Herzfeld et al. \cite{Herzfeld2014}
% conducted experiments to state that movement variability is not only noise but a
% source of movement exploration which at certain point of the exploration
% such variability is becoming a source of movement exploration.

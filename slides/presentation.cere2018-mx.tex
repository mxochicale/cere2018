\begin{frame}{What is Movement Variabily?}
MOVEMENT VARIABILITY is defined as the variations that occur in motor
performance across multiple repetitions of a task and such behaviour is 
an inherent feature within and between each person's movement.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Quantification Arm Movement Variability with Nonlinear Dynamics
        \item However,
        \item Timeseries from the landmarks are mounted on the pose location of the head. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Test other techniques of Nonlinear Dynamics, e.g. Lyapunov Exponents, Recurrent Quantification Analysis
	\item Use of Convolutional Neural Networks for automatic identification of Movement Variability
\end{itemize}

Come to my talk (4April2018, 17h15m, ROOM253) at @CERE_Emotion #CERE2018 @UofGlasgow
where I am presenting some preliminary results 
of the quantification of Movement Variability using  Nonlinear Dynamics 
which can hypothetically be applied to the problem of time varying facial expression.
(follow this thread for data/code/slides)

"Towards the Analysis of Movement Variability for Facial Expressions with Nonlinear Dynamics"

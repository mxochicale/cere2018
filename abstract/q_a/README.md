Some question after the abstract submission

Dear Sir or Madam,

I have successfully submitted an abstract to cere2018, however I have the following questions:
1. Do you have an exact day for the notification of acceptance?
2. Do you have any acceptance rate for previous conference and for this one?
3. If the abstract notification of acceptance is positive, do we have to submit a full paper using a determined template?


Regards

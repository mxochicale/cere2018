Some question after the abstract submission

Dear Sir or Madam,

I have successfully submitted an abstract to cere2018, however I have the following questions:
1. Do you have an exact day for the notification of acceptance?
2. Do you have any acceptance rate for previous conference and for this one?
3. If the abstract notification of acceptance is positive, do we have to submit a full paper using a determined template?


Regards

Dear Miguel

Thanks for your email.  
 
1. Do you have an exact day for the notification of acceptance?
No, but it should be mid January at the latest.

2. Do you have any acceptance rate for previous conference and for this one?
Not for previous conferences, but the aim of CERE is to be inclusive. Abstracts would only be completely rejected if they are already published, incomprehensible, not related to emotion, or not written in English.

3. If the abstract notification of acceptance is positive, do we have to submit a full paper using a determined template?
No. 

Let me know if you have any more questions. 

Best,

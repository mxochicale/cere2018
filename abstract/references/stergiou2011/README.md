TI  - Human Movement Variability, Nonlinear Dynamics, and Pathology: Is There A Connection?
AB  - Fields studying movement generation, including robotics, psychology, cognitive science and neuroscience utilize concepts and tools related to the pervasiveness of variability in biological systems. The concept of variability and the measures for nonlinear dynamics used to evaluate this concept open new vistas for research in movement dysfunction of many types. This review describes innovations in the exploration of variability and their potential importance in understanding human movement. Far from being a source of error, evidence supports the presence of an optimal state of variability for healthy and functional movement. This variability has a particular organization and is characterized by a chaotic structure. Deviations from this state can lead to biological systems that are either overly rigid and robotic or noisy and unstable. Both situations result in systems that are less adaptable to perturbations, such as those associated with unhealthy pathological states or absence of skillfulness.

Stergiou et al. 2011 contract two approaches to explore movement variability
i) conventional statistical tools like standard deviation
describe a value of magnitude variability from a central point
that are measuremnts of centrality. that not consider the dependency between events
ii) nonlinear dynamics that explore the variation of how motor behvaior emerge

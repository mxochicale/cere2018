TI  - Developmental Changes in the Primacy of Facial Cues for Emotion Recognition
AB  - There have been long-standing differences of opinion regarding the influence of the face relative to that of contextual information on how individuals process and judge facial expressions of emotion. However, developmental changes in how individuals use such information have remained largely unexplored and could be informative in attempting to reconcile these opposing views. The current study tested for age-related differences in how individuals prioritize viewing emotional faces versus contexts when making emotion judgments. To do so, we asked 4-, 8-, and 12-year-old children as well as college students to categorize facial expressions of emotion that were presented with scenes that were either congruent or incongruent with the facial displays. During this time, we recorded participantsâ€™ gaze patterns via eye tracking. College students directed their visual attention primarily to the face, regardless of contextual information. Children, however, divided their attention between both the face and the context as sources of emotional information depending on the valence of the context. These findings reveal a developmental shift in how individuals process and integrate emotional cues.

Not only the facial cues are important for emotion perception but also other
source of information such as hand gestures, body language, and the contextual information
where for instance, Aviezer et al. (2008) investigated that the facial features
were modulated by the emotion displayed in the context, in their experiments,
for example they observed that persons looked more to the eye region when the
conveyed emotion were anger or some others looked more the nose and mouth when
the conveyed emotion was disgust.
Additionally, the emotional perception varies from cross-cultural background
and social experiences.
